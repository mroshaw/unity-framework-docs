# Daft Apple Games - Unity Framework

The Daft Apple Games Unity Framework consists of a number of packages designed to offer distinct, core functionality to speed up and enhance development of games in Unity 6.

# Framework Packages

Currently, the framework consists of these packages:

## Daft Apple Core

Low level support classes and resources, providing consistent and efficient baseline classes for things like editor windows, class extensions, helper and utility classes and components.

## Building Tools

Run-time components, editor scripts, and editor windows designed to quickly set up functional buildings in a Unity project.

## HDRP Time and Weather

Run-time components, preconfigured volume profiles, audio and visual assets designed to deliver realistic real-time lighting in an HDRP project.

## Third Person Character Controller and AI

An extension of the fantastic "Easy Character Movement 2" character controller, offering addition player behaviours and a Behaviour Tree driven AI framework.

## Settings and UI Framework

A "themeable" UI framework, using Unity uGUI, alongside an extensible, easy to use set of run-time components and Scriptable Objects that give players the ability to tweak and tune their experience within your Unity project.
