# Set Up Tool

This tool simply sets up various required properties in your project, required by some of the other tools.

## Quick Overview

The Set Up tool:

- Adds 4 new "Layers" into your project, which are used to configure discrete "buckets" to manage interior and exterior building meshes, and interior and exterior props.
- Renames the existing "Rendering Layers", in index locations 1 and 2, used by the "Lighting Tools" to give you more control over how lighting effects various meshes in your building model.

## Detailed Usage

There's nothing more to this tool. Simply click to configure your project. If you want to revert the changes made by this tool, refer to the Uninstallation instructions linked on the left.
