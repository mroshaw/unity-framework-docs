# About Daft Apple Games

I am a hobby game developer who just loves to code! All of my game dev stuff I do for fun, and I like to give back to the community who helped me grow my knowledge and experience of the art of game development. I dabble in Unity, and have released one full game with another in active development.

## Daft Apple Games Design Philosophy

The packages that I build are always designed to be as useful and innocuous as possible. I aim to follow these core principles in all the tools and code that I publish:

- All of my code and packages are free and open source. Everything is free for you to use, change, make your own, do anything you like.
- All Run Time components are granular, optional and non-intrusive. Nothing is enforced by a package, and your hierarchy, project, and scene setup is not tampered with in any way unless itt's specifically a documented function of a tool or component.
- Any project level changes made by the tools are documented and reversible and detailed uninstallation instructions are always provided.
- I try to keep my code as clean and as error and warning free as possible, and I follow best practice principles as best I can. I employ Rider and SonarQube code quality checking to ensure optimum code and avoid "code smells".
- Assembly definitions are used where appropriate, to keep code clean, decoupled, safe, and ensure your project compile times are kept down.
- All Editor specific script is contained within "Editor Only" assembly definitions. My packages won't add unnecessary code to your game builds and you won't find my tools taking up valuable time in your update loop.
