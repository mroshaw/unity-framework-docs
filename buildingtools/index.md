# Daft Apple Building Tools

This package provides editor tools and run-time components to allow quick, consistent configuration of building assets in a Unity project. This includes setting up efficient and effective lighting, alignment of props with the terrain, automatically adding working doors, and mesh optimisation. The package comes with pre-sets and examples for configuring the excellent 3D Forge village assets. Third party assets are not required to use this package, however.
