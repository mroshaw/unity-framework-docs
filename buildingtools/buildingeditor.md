# Building Editor Tool

## Introduction

The Building Editor Tool is designed as a "one stop shop" for applying a number of changes to a building model or prefab instance.

The tool currently supports these functions:

- Building Layout 
- Prop Configuration
- Doors
- Lighting
- Mesh Optimisation 

This page contains details on how to use the Building Editor Tool, and goes into detail about how to use each of these core functions.

## The Building Editor Window

The main editor window can be accessed via the Unity editor menu:

```
Daft Apple Games > Building Tools > Building Editor
```

The window looks like this:

Each button represents a specific "Tool" in the package. You can find details of each of the tools using the navigation links on the left.

> [!TIP]
>
> All of the tools use the "Undo" feature of the Unity editor. Having run any one of the tools, you can completely undo any changes made via the "Undo History" menu item.
